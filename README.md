# CSE-103-Assignments
Solutions of some intermediate arithmetic problem given as assignments in structured programming (CSE 103) by C.

# Intermediate Arithmetic Operations in C
This repository contains the solutions to some intermediate arithmetic problems, created as part of my CSE 103 assignments. Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts in C programming, such as using operators, handling user input, and performing basic calculations with critical thinking.

# Problems Covered
1. Clock Angle Difference : Input time,calculate the angle difference between hour and minutes hand in an anlog clock.
2. My Turn in Lift : Input the number which person you are in the line,calculate your turn when you can enter in the lift.
3. Taxi Bill : Input hour and minute,calculate the totall bill.
4. Cylinder Volume Calculation : Input radius and height, calculate the volume.
5. Three Digit Number Separation : Input a three digit number,show the numbers separately.
# How to Use
Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RepositoryName.git

# Navigate to the folder for each problem and compile the code using a C compiler. For example:
gcc Problem1.c -o Problem1 ./Problem1

# About
These solutions are designed for foundational practice with C programming. They showcase intermediate arithmetic operations and demonstrate how to work with variables, user input, and calculations.
